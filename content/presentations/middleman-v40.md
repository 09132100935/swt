Thomas Reynolds is the Technical Director at famed Portland digital agency Instrument. Heâ€™s also the creator of Middleman, one of the most widely used static site generators for large enterprise sites like MailChimp, Sequoia Capitol and Vox Media.

With the release of v4.0 of Middleman, Reynolds did a major overhaul to the tool, which had been stable at version 3.0 for almost three years. Here, he discusses his reasons for the update, and walks through the changes.
