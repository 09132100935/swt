Parker Moore actually launched the biggest release yet of Jekyll (3.0), the most popular static site generator in the World.

Great session, great Q&A, and awesome to see it live.  And we got the whole thing on tape!

To celebrate the release, we hustled and got a tutorial together on [how to host a Jekyll 3.0 site](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-30-on-netlify) with automatic builds from a GitHub repo on netlify.
